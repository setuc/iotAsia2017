# iotAsia2017
This repository contains the code for the examples presented in IoT Asia 2017 on 30th March 2017. The presentation can be found [here](https://www.slideshare.net/SetuChokshi/time-series-predictions-using-lstms)

## Introduction
The presentation focused on how one can use LSTM for time series predictions. We use the sinWave and the Household Power Consumption from the [UCI repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption). The dataset is not included in this repository. 

### Requirements
This has been tested on an Ubuntu 14.04 machine. 
* Python 2.7
* Keras 2.0.2
* Theano 0.8
* Matplotlib 2.0.0
* Numppy 1.12.1
